BASH Dinosaur Guessing Game

Latest version includes family-based guessing, period-based guessing (with an addition of Fictional for dinos from the JW franchise that aren't real), and a random mode. Some dinos offer ASCII art from http://www.asciiworld.com/-Dinosaurs-.html and may be removed in future versions..

TODO:
-Add an option for "I don't know" which reverts to random mode.
-Add more dinos as they're suggested, mostly by 5 and 6 year olds.
